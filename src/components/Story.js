        Where do I start…Hester Coetzee opened “Die Emmertjie” (The Little
        Bucket) in September 2016 to live her dream of having a coffee shop and
        giving local art classes. She was an amazing artist (and some of her
        work is still on display in our garden). Hester was the kindest and
        gentlest person I ever met, with an enormous heart. She cared about
        everyone, but most of all she loved God. (Hester chose the name “Die
        Emmertjie” because she always said that her cup of life was
        overflowing). In January 2017 she asked if it would be possible for me
        to help her, because she loved giving her art classes but realised that
        she could not do those and run the coffee shop on her own. So, I started
        helping her. We had a lot of fun together, but it was not without tears.
        In February 2018 we found out that she had cancer. Sadly, she passed
        away in April 2018. Her husband was working in the Congo at the time and
        so it took a while until everything was sorted out. He decided to move
        on and a new chapter started for me and “Die Emmertjie”. With the help
        of good friends and family I bought the business and changed the name to
        “Emmertjie Velddrif”. The memories I have of Hester, the things we
        talked about and all that we planned on doing were the reasons for
        keeping “Emmertjie Veldrif”. It would have been impossible to just let
        go. Thanks to all our regular customers we are still going strong. To
        all of you sitting here today, both regulars and visitors to our
        wonderful community, thank you for your support and helping us grow.
        With love and much appreciation <span>Anzél (Owner and Head Chef)</span>
